<h2>Working Career</h2>
    <p>After working in a Customer Service type role most my life, and having previously not known what I wanted to do with my career. I found myself working for a small software company, and began getting interested in coding. I therefore have begun my journey into learning how to do it.. wish me luck!</p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>I grew up in York and have always considered myself to be a Yorkshire boy, despite being born in Lancashire ...I know.</p>
<p>I've lived in a few places around the North East, Midlands and i'm currently living in Manchester, I love it. So glad I decided to move here.</p>
